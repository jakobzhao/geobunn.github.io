## Education

Ph.D.:moneybag: Civil Engineering, [Oregon State University](https://cce.oregonstate.edu/phd-degree-requirements) June 2019 (Expected)

M.S., Civil Engineering, [Oregon State University](https://cce.oregonstate.edu/ms-civil-engineering-degree-requirements) March 2016

B.S., Civil Engineering, [University of Portland](https://engineering.up.edu/abet-accredited-undergraduate-programs/civil-engineering.html)	May 2014

## Experience

Graduate Research Assistant, Oregon State University.	January 2016 – Present
>Topic: *Enhancing Landslide Inventorying, Hazard Assessment and Asset Management Using Lidar.*
>Overview: Developed novel tools for identifying landslide deposits and assessing impacts on infrastructure. These tools are being adopted by DOGAMI and ODOT for enhanced infrastructure resilience.
>Advisors: Ben Leshchinsky and Michael J. Olsen

Graduate Research Assistant, Oregon State University	June 2014 – December 2015
>Topic: *Evaluation of the Performance of Lateral Spread Displacement Empirical Models for Subduction Zone Earthquake Case Histories.*
>Advisor: Daniel. T. Gillins
>Overview: Advanced the current state-of-knowledge for evaluating lateral spreading hazard. This work improved current methods to account for subduction zone events, important for assessing resilience towards liquefaction in the Pacific Northwest and worldwide.
